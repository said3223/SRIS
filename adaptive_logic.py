    """
    Adjusts the list of generated hypotheses based on the current reasoning mode
    and deeper semantic understanding of the perception context.

    Args:
        hypotheses (list[str]): The raw list of generated hypotheses.
        current_mode (str): The current reasoning mode (e.g., 'analytical', 'threat_response', 'creative_exploration').
        current_perception_context (dict, optional): A dictionary providing context from the current perception analysis.
                                                     Defaults to None.

    Returns:
        list[str]: The adjusted list of hypotheses.
